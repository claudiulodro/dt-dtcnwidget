                              ReFeed Installation

    1. Edit the file config.php with your local configuration
       information:

        REF_TIME_OFFSET
                Difference, in hours, between your server and your local
                time zone.

        REF_USE_KEYBOARD
                Use the keyboard-sensitive navigation and functionality

        REF_DB_HOST
                Host where your MySQL server is located, often
                "localhost".

        REF_DB_USER, REF_DB_PASS
                Database user account and password. Be sure that the
                database user you set up has create, drop and alter
                privileges on the refeed database, for this installation.
                Normal use requires select, insert, update and delete
                privileges.

        REF_DB_DBNAME
                Name of your database.

        REF_HTTPAUTH_NAME, REF_HTTPAUTH_PASS
                User name and password for HTTP authentication: if set,
                you will be prompted forthis information when you attempt
                to use the parts of reFeed that change the database.

        REF_FEED_TITLE
                Title of your outgoing feed.

        REF_FEED_DESCRIPTION
                Description of your outgoing feed.

        REF_GUID_TAG_PREFIX
                Globally unique identifying prefix for items in your
                outgoing feed. If you don't know what this is, odds are
                you don't need to change it.

    2. Upload the entire tree to wherever on your server you want reFeed
       to live.
    3. Create a directory called cache inside your reFeed directory, and
       make it world-writeable (chmod a+rwX cache).
    4. Load the page http://{your server}/{wherever you put
       reFeed}/install.php. The installer will first check that it can
       connect to your DB, and then attempt to upgrade your database
       tables from a previous version (i.e. Feed on Feeds or ReceSS), or
       create new ones.
       Then, it will attempt to create a subdirectory called cache where
       it will store cached copies of RSS feeds. This part of the
       installation may fail, as your PHP process may not have permission
       to create a directory. You may need to create the directory
       {wherever you uploaded reFeed to}/cache/ yourself, and make sure
       it is writable by the PHP process. If you needed to do that,
       reload install.php.
    5. Play around and figure out how it works. It's pretty
       straightforward. Or see the README file in this directory.
